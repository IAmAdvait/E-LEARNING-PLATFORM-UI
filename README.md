*DESCRIPTION*: This project is a front-end layout for an eLearning platform built with pure HTML and CSS. It includes a homepage that lists various courses and individual course pages that provide video content and track progress. The design is fully responsive, aiming to offer a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

The `index.html` file serves as the homepage of the platform. It presents a list of available courses as simple text links labeled "Course 1", "Course 2", and so on. Clicking on any of these links takes the user to the respective course page. The page also features a navigation bar at the top and a footer at the bottom, maintaining a complete and structured layout.

The `course1.html`, `course2.html`, and `course3.html` files represent individual course pages. Each of these pages includes a course title, an embedded video player to simulate course content, and a progress bar to help learners track their completion. The layout and design stay consistent with the homepage, providing a unified look across the platform.

The `style.css` file controls the visual appearance of the entire platform. It defines the color scheme, spacing, typography, responsive layout, and the styling of elements like buttons, containers, and the progress bar. The design emphasizes clarity and simplicity, ensuring learners can focus on the content without distractions.

To get started, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. No setup or dependencies are required. This project provides a basic but functional front-end foundation for an eLearning platform and can be expanded further with JavaScript functionality, backend integration, or user authentication if needed.
